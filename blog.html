            <h1>Protecting Creativity – Our Copyright Policy</h1>
				<p>At <strong>Banjo'dio</strong>, we believe original ideas deserve protection. As digital technology keeps growing, copying and sharing content has become easier and so has copyright misuse. That’s why we’ve created a copyright policy that protects our work and supports our clients’ rights. Our policy is based on the Australian Copyright Act 1968 and includes clear rules about intellectual property, agreements, and digital protection tools.</p>
				<p>Our goal is to design creative digital content - like websites, graphics, and branding - that is 100% original and safe. We work closely with clients to make sure they legally own what they’ve paid for, and we take strong steps to stop unauthorised use of our work or anyone else’s. This policy keeps our work fair, legal, and respectful for everyone.</p>
				<p><strong>Our policy focuses on:</strong></p>
				<ul>
				<li><em><strong>Copyright and Intellectual Property</strong> – What creators legally own.</li>
				<li><strong>Designer/Proprietor Agreements</strong> – Who owns the final design and how it can be used.</li>
				<li><strong>Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)</strong> – Tools like watermarks, login access, and encryption that help protect our digital products.</li>
				<li><strong>Social, Ethical, and Economic Responsibility</strong> – We act fairly, respect others' rights, and help create a professional, legal design community.</em></li>
				</ul>

			<h2>The Australian Copyright Act 1968</h2>
            <p>The main law that guides our copyright policy is the <strong>Australian Copyright Act 1968</strong>. This act gives automatic legal protection to original works like drawings, writing, graphics, music, videos, and more.</p>

            <p><strong>Important points from the act:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creators automatically have copyright from the moment they make the work (no registration needed).</li>
                <li>Copyright protects the creator’s work from being copied, sold, or changed without permission.</li>
                <li>It usually lasts for the creator’s life plus 70 years.</li>
                <li>Using a work without permission is called <em>copyright infringement</em>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This law also allows creators to take legal steps to stop or get payment for unauthorised use of their work. Following this law is a key part of staying fair, legal, and professional in our digital design business.</p>
			
			<h2>Copyright Infringement</h2>
			<p><strong>Copyright infringement</strong> happens when someone uses a copyrighted work without permission. This can include copying images, reusing a design, or editing work without giving credit. It is illegal and can lead to fines or lawsuits.</p>
			<p>Breaking copyright laws can lead to legal trouble, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fines of up to <strong>$117,000</strong> for individuals in Australia</li>
				<li>Fines of up to <strong>$585,000</strong> for businesses</li>
				<li>Being ordered by the court to stop using or remove the copied work</li>
				<li>Having to pay money (damages) to the original creator</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To avoid infringement, our company:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Only uses our own original designs or designs with permission</li>
				<li>Gives full credit when using other people’s work</li>
				<li>Trains team members to understand copyright rules</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p><strong>Intellectual Property (IP)</strong> means owning the rights to something you created, like a logo, website layout, or digital artwork. It is a valuable asset in any creative business. Our company respects both our own IP and that of others.</p>

			<p>We protect our IP by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Signing contracts with clients and designers (Designer/Proprietor Agreements)</li>
				<li>Clearly stating who owns the work after it’s finished</li>
				<li>Allowing usage only when agreed upon</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)</h2>
			<p><strong>Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)</strong> are digital tools used to protect online work. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Watermarks on images</li>
				<li>Password-protected files</li>
				<li>Encryption</li>
				<li>Limited access downloads</li>
			</ul>

            <p>Our company uses these tools to keep our work safe from copying, hacking, or unauthorised sharing. It also protects our clients’ private or paid content.</p>

			<h2>Social, Ethical, and Economic Effects</h2>
			<p>Following copyright laws has a positive effect on both our design company and our clients. Socially, it helps build trust and shows that we act professionally and fairly. Clients feel confident knowing their work is protected and handled with respect. Ethically, we always do the right thing by giving credit to original creators and never copying someone else’s work without permission. This shows we value honesty and fairness in everything we do. Economically, protecting our work means others can’t steal or sell it without approval, so our business can grow safely and keep its value. It also gives clients peace of mind that their designs are legal, original, and safe from future copyright problems.</p>
